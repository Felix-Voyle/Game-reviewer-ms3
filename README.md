## Design

* Colour Scheme
Main colour scheme for the site will be a dark theme with #2F3437 (Onyx) and #666666 (Dim Gray) for headers background colours and cards. I will then be using a mix of #FF7073 (Light Coral), #9CF6F6 (Celeste) and #FOE5E9 (Lavender Blush) to stand out against the darker main colours of the backgrounds. These colours compliment each other well and I feel give a video game theme type feel to the website. 

* Typography
Permanent Marker font will be used for the main branding for the site in the header. The rest of the site will use Zen Kurenaido which is clear and easy to read and also gives a video game type feel.

* Imagery
